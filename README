This is my personal wrapper to mpc, the CLI client for MPD [http://www.musicpd.org/]. It's intended to make adding random music to the playlist as easy as possible.

Be sure and check the top of the script for some things to set. The script is not likely to work for you until you at least empty out the $toplevelWhitelist array.

Usage:

   -h,  --hostname       set the target host (default: localhost)
   -p,  --port           set the target port (default: 6600)
   -rt, --random-tracks  add random tracks to the playlist
   -10, --ten            play/add 10 random tunes
   -bt, --by-toplevel    ask which toplevel dir to use (a short code CAN follow)
   -ra, --random-album   play/add random album
   -c,  --count          how many tracks to add (default: 10)
   -ta, --this-album     play/add the album from which the current song is
   -a,  --append         add tunage, peserving the current playlist
        --mpc            full path to mpc executable
   -d,  --debug          echo debugging information
   -q,  --quiet          sssshhh
   -?,  --help           this.
